The BugBu 260 has a printable area of 235x235x300 unless you slap on a Bambu build plate, then you get 260x250x300 build volume.  This uses a cantilever bed to eliminate the closed loop belt system.  All part are printed at 6 walls and 20% infill minimum, designed for 0.4 nozzle at 0.2 layer height.  With lots of testing hours, it is working well currently on the cantilever, but there will be mods coming for it to give a couple of bed operation options.
