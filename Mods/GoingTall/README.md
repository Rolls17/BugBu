This mod is ONLY for the 310 version of the BugBu. Just replace the same
name parts from the BugBu 310 list with these parts to go tall. You will also
need 2 - MGN12 linear rails for this mod. The linear rails will need to be
50mm shorter than the extrusions you are using for height. For example: If
you order 4 - 500mm extrusions for the height, you would need 2 mgn12
at 450mm. You will also need to use more braces, and be sure your bug is
secured to the table or bench it is on, is it will be top heavy with this mod.
Additional Parts Needed/Deleted from 310 BOM:
ADD - 2 EA: MGN12 linear rails. These will replace 2 linear rods, but you
will still need 1 Linear rod the same length as your Z extrusions. The
MGN12 will need to be 50mm Shorter as noted above
DELETE - 2 EA: Linear Rods for the Z and Linear Bearings for the Z
All other parts in the 310 BOM will remain the same.
